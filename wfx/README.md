# WFx Wi-Fi FMAC driver

The **WFx Wi-Fi Full-MAC (FMAC) driver** enables a host device to communicate
with Silicon Labs Wi-Fi transceivers and take advantage of the capabilities
listed below. The FMAC driver is built in a way that allows it to easily be
ported on new platforms. It fits **bare metal architectures as well as RTOS
based implementations**.

Implementation examples are available on several platforms in the [WFx FMAC tools repository](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wfx-fullMAC-tools).

The **latest driver documentation** is available at [docs.silabs.com](https://docs.silabs.com/wifi/wf200/rtos/latest/index).

## WF200 Wi-Fi Transceiver

The Silicon Labs WF200 is an **Ultra Low Power Wi-FiÂ® transceiver** or network
co-processor (NCP) targeted for applications where optimal RF performance,
low-power consumption, and secure end-to-end solution, together with fast time
to market, are key requirements. The WF200 integrates the Balun, T/R switch, LNA
and PA for best possible RF performance. WF200 has been optimized for resource
and power constrained devices at the RF, protocol and firmware levels. Power
conscious devices can take advantage of these features in both active and
idle/sleep modes. For security sensitive applications WF200 provides secure boot
and a secure & encrypted host interface. Robust security is made possible with a
native integrated True Random Number Generator and OTP memory for confidential
encryption key storage. The WF200 fits well with Linux-based and RTOS based host
processors. WF200 supports both the 802.11 split MAC and the 802.11 full MAC
architectures. It communicates with the external host controller over the **SPI
or SDIO interface**.

The WF200 can act as a **full-MAC wireless device and WPA2 personal supplicant**.
The firmware exposes a full-MAC API at the **IP packet level**. It also manages
WPA2 personal authentication process as well as automatic roaming.
